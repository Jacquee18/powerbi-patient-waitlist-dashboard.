# Power BI Dashboard — Patient Waitlist Analysis (2018–2021)


This project demonstrates a Power BI dashboard built to analyze patient waitlists across **2018–2021**, covering Outpatient, Inpatient, and Day Case records.I wanted to practice dashboard development while exploring how data can uncover hidden stories in healthcare.

###  Why It Matters
Understanding patient waitlists can help hospitals plan better staffing and resource allocation.  
Even a simple dashboard like this can reveal patterns that guide better healthcare decisions.

##  What I Analyzed
- Year-on-year waitlist trends (2018 → 2021)  
- Case type comparisons: Outpatient vs Inpatient vs Day Case  
- Age profiles vs wait time bands  
- Specialty-level average wait counts  

##  The Story Behind the Dashboard

When I first explored the 2018–2021 patient waitlist data, I wanted to understand **how healthcare capacity changed over time**.  
I started by exploring CSV files for different years (Op_WL 2018.csv, Op_WL 2019.csv, etc.) and cleaning the data to ensure consistent columns and formatting.
Once combined, I began experimenting with visuals — testing which ones told the clearest story.

Some visuals I used:

Cards to summarize total counts and key metrics.
Clustered bar charts to compare waitlist sizes by year.
Filters & slicers to allow users to explore inpatient vs. outpatient data interactively.

I discovered that outpatient cases made up the majority, but their wait times increased significantly in 2020 — likely due to the pandemic impact.  

Digging deeper, I compared **specialty vs. waiting bands** and noticed certain departments consistently had longer waitlists.  
This insight could help decision-makers prioritize resource allocation and reduce bottlenecks.  
Once combined, I began experimenting with visuals — testing which ones told the clearest story.

The dashboard tells this story visually — from a broad overview to granular specialty-level insights.

##Why It Matters

Understanding patient waitlist patterns helps hospitals:
Identify overburdened departments
Plan staff allocation efficiently
Track the impact of events like the pandemic on patient care

Even a simple dashboard can make a difference when it helps leaders act faster and smarter.

###  Challenges & Lessons
- My first challenge was choosing visuals that clearly communicate differences between years.  
- I also learned the importance of consistent data formatting when merging multiple CSV files.  
- I plan to improve this dashboard by adding drill-through functionality and trend analysis.
